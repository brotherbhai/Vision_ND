This repository contains project files for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program which I enrolled on 10 August, 2019.

## Projects

### Facial Keypoint Detection
>[P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/nz-is/CVND-Projects/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)

In this project, I build a facial keypoint detection system. The system consists of a face detector that uses Haar Cascades and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predict the facial keypoints in the detected faces. The facial keypoint detection system takes in any image with faces and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.


### Automatic Image Captioning(TODO)
>[P2_Image_captioning](https://github.com/nz-is/CVND-Projects/tree/master/P2_Image_Captioning)

Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an imput image.

### Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM) (TODO)
>[P3_SLAM](https://github.com/nz-is/CVND-Projects/tree/master/P3_SLAM)

Implement Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world
